Metroidvania Roguelike
--> similar to dead cells in concept, has key roguelike aspects, returning from death and randomizes runs, but embracing the metroidvania aspects much more wholly than deadcells, where the metroid like abilities are perminant, so the metroidvania aspects are completely absent of the actual gameplay past the first couple hours. For my game i would have upgrades that give abilities that allow further exploration each run to be lost on death, so you have to learn were each upgrade is to continue your run.

-- multiple areas
the game would have many different areas / zones that would stay largely static in relation to each other, like how each deadcells area always connects to the same ones. I would try to have to the indivdual rooms to feel closer to hollow knights, with many human designed rooms that are randomly connected, with some game logic to make sure each area is largely the same size each time, and a balance between the difficulty of rooms in each area between each run, in addition to ensuring that every run can be completed, and all abilities are acessable.

-- backtracking
in almost all roguelikes, there is absolutely no backtracking in a run, it is a straight run to the end, much would disrupt much of the metroidvania experence, instead I would allow complete freedom of movement provided the player has the abilities and tools to access certain rooms.

-- perminent upgrades
many roguelikes, like deadcells and hades, have perminent upgrades that while making the game easier, and giving the game a strange difficulty curve, serve to give the player a bit more motivation despite runs failing, making not every run seem useless, and give the player something to strive toward. these upgrades should be equipable items that improve the players abilities that can be found in runs, sort of like charms in hollow knight, a limited amount of consumables that could be found in runs, and then stored in certain areas, so stored items will persist through runs, a bit like the home area in games like escape from tarkov. there could be abilities that DO presist, but only those that affect the combat moveset, but I am unsure if this would take away from the game's feel.

-- type of abilities / general gamefeel
I think the game should try to emulate hollow knights feeling of adventure and exploration, but on account of it being a roguelike and the player being expected to die, and them losing all their progress each time they die so abilites should be a bit more clustered that in hollow knight, and the enemy difficulty should also be lesser, as although hk enemies are not that hard, the player cannot die without resetting, so the consistency required is higher. the abilites could be both movement related, providing both access to more areas, and more manuverability in combat, more combat centric abilites should be both actually a viable stragiety, and also an environmental function to some capacity. (also as a potential stretch idea, there could be interaction between abilities, like a bomb dealing more damage to frozen enemies)

-- endings
there should be only a few manditory bosses to reach the ending, but also alternate endings behind additional / alternate bosses that could only be acessed through finding certain items that are either locked behind optional bosses, or hidded throughout the map --> the first item you pick up every run should be a bit of a dummy item that is right at the start, and teaches the player about items, and in addition to hinting about the optional bosses. this item could also "activate" after the player achieve all of the optional endings, unlocking a "ultimate" boss the true ending.
